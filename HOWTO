tests.py
--------

The tests.py script contains automated tests for testing the functionality of the 'RomanConvertor' script.
It was developed in Python 2.7 and has no third party dependencies. To execute the test suite:
'''
	# Add execute only access permission
    chmod +x tests.py
    # Execute the test cases
    ./tests.py
'''

Known issues to be discussed
````````````````````````````
1) Roman numerals containing invalid latin characters e.g. CRA (in this case 'A' is not a valid roman latin character),
they do not return 0.

Input : CRA
Actual output : 100
Expected output: 0

2) Very big numbers (1,000 - 1,000,000 V̅L̅C̅M̅) are not recognisable by the script.

Input : V̅
Actual output : 5
Expected output : 5,000


roman_scanner.py
----------------
The roman_scanner.py script is a basic framework  to scan online plain text documents for roman numeral
and report where they are found. It was developed in Python 2.7 and has no third party dependencies.
To execute the script:
'''
	# Add execute only access permission
    chmod +x roman_scanner.py
    # Execute the script
    ./roman_scanner.py
'''

The script will scan the online document in this order :

1) The script identifies many false-positive words as potential roman numerals. For instance 'I' personal pronoun, and
valid english words which are valid roman numerals 'id'.
